// player uses keys to guide object across the screen
//? key logic and boundaries on grid 

// player to jump onto certain safe grounds
//? certain grid boxes will always be "open" and players will be able to stay on them
//? no bad assosciation with these boxes

// if player misses an open box (e.g. maybe because it is moving?) or they misplace their step, they fall ( e.g. into the sea) and lose a life
//? when object does not successfully come into contact with open box....
//? ... it means they do come into contact with a "closed" box will...
//? automatically illicit a reaction that makes player die/lose life

// obstacles move horizonally  across screen
// if player comes into contact with a moving obstacle, they lose a life
//? timer function to move objects across screen --> CSS animations for movement?
//? contact = when obstacle and object are in the same box at the same time 

// player wins by successfully moving object to far side of screen
//? when object manages to move to certain grid number

// players have certain number of lives until game is over
//? have 3 different "rounds", if player dies, move onto next round until die in round 3 and game over

// BONUS TASKS
// players can win back lives by gaining certain objects
//? if certain object appears and player makes contact, player moves back a round
// various different levels
//? same game, but obstacles move quicker and size of grid is larger so more obstacles and safe grounds
// player can gain points along the way
//? by interacting with certain objects, player gets more points
//(can create a diagonal move??)
//? holding down the up and left/right arrow keys to move diagonally
// obstacles moving vertically across screen - "cheat" move
//? once object is in same box at same time as these, the obstacle "carries" the object to the top of the gric
// player is able to choose what object they are
// start screen with start button and timer countdown to game start
