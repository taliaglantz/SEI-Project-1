// player uses keys to guide object across the screen
// key logic on grid that we learnt today

// player to jump onto certain "safe paths" within grid
// the would show the object on these paths

// if player "misses" a path (e.g. because it is moving) or they misplace their step, they fall and lose a life
// player falling into water (or something similar) would be when they miss a path i.e. when object does not successfully come into contact with good path

// obstacles move horizonally (or vertically?!?!) across screen - timer funtion - how to do contact?
// if player comes into contact with a moving obstacle, they lose a life

// player wins by successfully moving object to far side of screen

// players have certain number of lives until game is over

// BONUS TASKS
// players can win back lives by gaining certain objects
// various different levels determined by speed of moving obstacles, size of screen et.
//(can create a diagonal move??)
